# Floating-star-Multiple
3D printable floating star multiple for thonkiconn jacks and M4*10mm nut/bolt.

Print both sides, cut off the R pin of all six thonkiconns, place them in an alternating fashion so that the ground leads and signal leads are close together.
Next solder the signal and ground leads to eachother and to six wires in two triangle shapes to connect the appropriate pins of the connectors. See picture for more details.
